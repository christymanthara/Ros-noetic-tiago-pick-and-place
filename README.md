The objective of this project is to enable the robot Tiago to perform a fetch and delivery task. In a simulated environment, there are two rooms divided by a wall, along with some obstacles scattered around. In the first room, a table with several objects (red, blue, and green) is positioned for Tiago to fetch, while gold hexagons, which Tiago must avoid to prevent collisions, are also present. Tiagoâ€™s task is to pick up the correct objects in a specified order without colliding with any undesired objects, then move to the second room where color-coded tables are located. Tiago needs to identify the table associated with each object's color, approach it, place the object there, and return to the initial room. The task is successfully completed once Tiago accurately places the objects on the designated tables in the correct order.
